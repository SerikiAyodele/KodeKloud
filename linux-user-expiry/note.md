> A developer named javed has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for javed. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with an expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named javed on the App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

    1. sudo useradd javed 
    2. sudo chage -E 2021-01-28 javed
    3. sudo chage -l javed
